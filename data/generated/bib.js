        "abstract": "| ABSTRACT This research explored movie recommendation systems based on predicting top-rated and suitable movies for users. This research proposed a hybrid movie recommendation system that integrates both text-to-number conversion and cosine similarity approaches to predict the most top-rated and desired movies for the targeted users. The proposed movie recommendation employed the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm to reinforce the accuracy of movie recommendations. The performance analysis and evaluation were undertaken by employing the widely used \"TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset\" from the Kaggle dataset. Two experiments were conducted, categorizing the dataset into distinct modules, and the outcomes were contrasted with state-of-the-art models. The first experiment attained a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.97613, while the second experiment expanded predictions to 4800 movies, culminating in a substantially minimized RMSE of 0.8951, portraying a 97% accuracy enhancement. The findings underscore the essence of parameter selection in text-to-number conversion and cosine and the gap for other systems to maintain user preferences for comprehensive and precise data gathering. Overall, the proposed hybrid movie recommendation system demonstrated promising results in predicting top-rated movies and offering personalized and accurate recommendations to users. |",

        "abstract": "We are living in a digital era, nowadays everything starting from shopping to entertainment is easily accessible online to all the age groups, thanks to the user-friendly interface. This technological advancement was maximized during COVID-19 and continues to flourish till now. But this development made about 29.1 percent of the population that consists of children under the age of 18 vulnerable to movies, shows having illegal and adult content. Not only this, even for adults it can be a tiresome process to scroll through a long list of movies on sites just to find that one movie of your taste. In such cases, a recommendation system will help the user filter out the content easily. In this paper, we have done detailed data analysis over the IMDB movie dataset and created a recommendation system where users can look for movies on the basis of actor, director, genre, language etc. This system works using the concept of correlation and feature engineering.",

        "abstract": "Recommendation systems (RSs) have garnered immense interest for applications in e-commerce and digital media. Traditional approaches in RSs include such as collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF) through these approaches that have certain limitations, such as the necessity of prior user history and habits for performing the task of recommendation. To minimize the effect of such limitation, this article proposes a hybrid RS for the movies that leverage the best of concepts used from CF and CBF along with sentiment analysis of tweets from microblogging sites. The purpose to use movie tweets is to understand the current trends, public sentiment, and user response of the movie. Experiments conducted on the public database have yielded promising results.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of the online media sharing sites (e.g. Youtube, Youku, and Hulu) have introduced new challenges in program recommendation in online networks. However, there is a bottleneck that the amount of available viewing logs and user friendship networks are too limited to design effective recommendation algorithms. Thus, carrying out an intelligent program recommendation system is important for these sites. In this work, we propose a novel model which turns to the social networks and mine user preferences information expressed in microblogs for evaluating the similarity between online movies and TV episodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first effort to bridge the gap between movie and TV watchers domain with social network activities. Moreover, it is the first approach that can solve the \u201ccold-start\u201d problem in movie and TV recommendation system. Series of data mining approaches and social computing models have been adopted in this work. Similar programs found from the social network are further used to suggest programs in other media devices. This work can be easily applied in online media streaming sites in order that intelligent recommendations of programs can be made to the customers through mining microblogs.",

        "abstract": "An Advanced Recommendation System is a system that provides accurate and efficient suggestions to the users for certain resources like books, medicines, movies, songs, etc., based on the specific data set containing the previously used resources by the users. The Movie recommendation system predicts what movies a user will enjoy based on the attributes of the previously watched movies by the user. This system leverages the historical user interactions with movies to predict the preferences and recommend the relevant content. Many critical attributes can be considered while designing a movie recommendation system like the genre of the movie, actors, crew, the director of the movie. The systems accuracy to recommend movies can be improved by a combination of two or more of these attributes.The Recommendation systems are particularly valuable for organizations that collect extensive customer data and aim to optimize their recommendations. They play a pivotal role in enhancing user experience by providing personalized suggestions for movies. The research work aims to build an advanced, stable and accurate recommendation system, which will be done by using a hybrid version of Content-based filtering and Cosine Similarity. Additionally, the system proposed is user friendly by providing the option to download the latest recommended movies dataset according to their popularity, vote count, likes and ratings. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of our proposed Movie Recommendation system, related work, proposed work, result analysis and conclusions.",

It carries out comprehensive aggregation of user's preferences, reviews, and emotions to help them find suitable movies conveniently. However, it requires both accuracy and timeliness. In this paper, a movie recommendation framework based on a hybrid recommendation model and sentiment analysis on Spark platform is proposed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of mobile movie recommender system. In the proposed approach, we first use a hybrid recommendation method to generate a preliminary recommendation list. Then sentiment analysis is employed to optimize the list. Finally, the hybrid recommender system with sentiment analysis is implemented on Spark platform. The hybrid recommendation model with sentiment analysis outperforms the traditional models in terms of various evaluation criteria. Our proposed method makes it convenient and fast for users to obtain useful movie suggestions.",
